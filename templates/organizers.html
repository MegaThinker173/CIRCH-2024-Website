                            "Last year, I was part of the CIRCH Leadership team and enjoyed the process of drawing out teamwork and leading a successful conference. I wanted to continue contributing to this meaningful cause of fostering student interest in research and innovation, especially since I learned from my prior experience that there could certainly be points of improvement in our team management as an organization on the whole. I hope we keep on growing! As for my hobbies, I love listening to music as well as playing music. I am a pianist and flutist (as well as a former guitarist and clarinetist). Music just gives me that comfort whenever I need it. I think creating melodic harmony with others helps me feel a sense of connection and learn to empathize better. I also enjoy skiing. I've nearly mastered my A-shaped ‘pflug-bogen', so I'm now working on my stem-christie turns. I really love the thrilling ride of perilous peaks and valleys! I sincerely hope this conference would encourage more students to continue researching and exploring their fields of interest.

Now, as a junior and Head of the Communications Department, I relish the chance to learn throughout the conference process. The satisfaction of seeing CIRCH evolve and succeed is exciting and immensely gratifying. In my free time, I enjoy reading, and programming machine learning systems. Machine Learning enables me to approach and tackle real-world problems from various perspectives and in great detail. My love of reading has opened myriad doors to worlds, ideas, and perspectives — enriching my empathy and understanding of diverse cultures and philosophies. Reading challenges my thoughts, broadens my knowledge, and fuels my curiosity, whatever the genre may be.”

Moreover, I would also like to publish my own paper after I have enough experience and CIRCH will be a great ground to help me publish my paper as well as to learn research techniques and higher-level writing skills. I love playing golf because it gives me an opportunity to work out as well as socialize with various people. In golf you can also compete against yourself like you do most of the time in life, which I think it really teaches you life!"
